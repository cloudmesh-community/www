Cloudmesh cm4 is an ongoing project worked upon by entire class to create a network of computers that run parallel jobs. Currently it accepts commands via command line.

Our project provides an user interface to Cloudmesh cm4. In our project, we have implemented a client-server application which will accept commands from user interface and pass it to server which will perform corresponding appropriate actions. Our second aim with this project is to demonstrate client server communication through GraphQL Apis.

More info for GraphQL is available as a chapter in cloud computing handbook.
