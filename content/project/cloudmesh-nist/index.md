We identify interfaces that are instrumental for the interaction with
Clouds, Containers, and High Performance Computing (HPC) systems to
manage virtual clusters to support the NIST Big Data Reference
Architecture (NBDRA). The REpresentational State Transfer (REST)
paradigm is used to define these interfaces, allowing easy integration
and adoption by a wide variety of frameworks.
