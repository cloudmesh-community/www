## Version Client 

Cloudmesh client is a simple client to enable access to multiple cloud
environments form a command shell and commandline. It is grown out of
the need to simplify access to multiple clouds for researchers and
students easily. In contrast to our earlier versions of cloudmesh it
explicitly separates the code to only target client code. Due to this
simplification it is also possible to install the client code not only
on Linux, OSX, but also Windows. We have tested the installation on
Windows 10. THis is a reimplementation of Version 3, but has some
reduced functionality. However it is possible to use it on Windows.

* Version 4, but still also see version 3: <https://github.com/cloudmesh/client>

## Version 3 (still active)

Cloudmesh client is a simple client to enable access to multiple cloud
environments form a command shell and commandline. It is grown out of
the need to simplify access to multiple clouds for researchers and

explicitly separates the code to only target client code. Due to this
simplification it is also possible to install the client code not only
on Linux and  OSX. (This version has not been tested on Windows).
