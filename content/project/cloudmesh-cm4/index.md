Cloudmesh client Dev or also called cm4 is a reimplementation of
cloiudmesh client, while focussing entirely on Python 3.7.

IN cloudmesh V1, and 2, we used MOngoDB. In version 3 we replaced it
with SQLLite. However We found that flattening the data structures
into sql although working ahs some limitations. To overcome them we
reintegrate Mongo DB.
