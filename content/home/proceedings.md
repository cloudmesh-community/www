ePubs are best read on MacOS with [Books](https://www.apple.com/apple-books/), Windows with [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge), or  [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/), and Linux with [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/). In Future we will provide HTML and PDF versions fore those that do not use ePuB readers much. 


### Lecture Notes
 

#### Cloud Computing

[{{< button PDF >}} ](https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/book/raw/master/vonLaszewski-cloud.pdf)

> * Version: Fall2018
> * Editors: Gregor von Laszewski, Geoffrey C. Fox, Fugang Wang
> * Classes: E516, E416, B649
> * Description: This document contains an Introduction to Cloud Computing
>   augmented with many practical technical examples. It show cases
>   how to use virtual machines, containers, and function as a
>   Service. Common platforms such as Hadoop are also introduced. Most
>   of the examples are provided in Python.
> * Comments: This is the class that you want to take to learn
>   about Cloud Computing in detail. It is a technical class,
>   requiring you typically  to do three assignments. A paper about a
>   cloud technology, a project related to clouds.

#### Cloud Computing with Raspberry Pi's [ {{< button ePub >}} ](https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/book/vonLaszewski-pi.epub?raw=true)

> * Version: Early alpha
> * Editors: Gregor von Laszewski
> * Classes: E516, E416, B649
> * Description: This document contains an Introduction to Cloud Computing
>   augmented with many practical technical examples specifically
>   targeted for the Raspberry PI. PI's are a good way to model cloud
>   environments with real hardware. Most of the examples are provided
>   in Python.
>* Comments: This set of notes enhances the *Cloud Computing* notes
>   while focussing on Raspberry Pis and IoT. As part of this your
>   project will be to create a Raspberry PI Cloud cluster. Residential
>   students have access to 200 Raspberry PI's


#### Big Data Applications and Analytics [ {{< button ePub >}} ](https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/book/blob/master/vonLaszewski-bigdata-application.epub?raw=true)

> * Version: Fall2018
> * Editors: Geoffrey C. Fox,  Gregor von Laszewski, Fugang Wang
> * Classes: e534, I523, I423 
> * Description: This document contains an Introduction to Big dada
>   and analytics. It focusses on a large number of applications.
> * Comments: Although this class also is focussing on a project,
>   Students have the ability to chose a report only option with
>   reduced grade. This is an introductory class. The project is
>   related to big data.


#### Cloud and Big Data Technologies [ {{< button ePub >}} ](https://github.com/cloudmesh/technologies/blob/master/vonLaszewski-cloud-technologies.epub?raw=true) [ {{< button PDF >}} ](https://github.com/cloudmesh/technologies/blob/master/vonLaszewski-cloud-technologies.pdf?raw=true)[{{< button github >}}  ](https://github.com/cloudmesh/technologies)

> * Version: Fall2018
> * Editors: Gregor von Laszewski
> * Classes: e534, I523, I423 
> * Description: This collection contains a very large number of
>   technologies related to Cloud Computing and Big Data. It serves as
>   a catalog that introduces students to technologies so they can
>   gain an overview of some technologies.
> * Comment: This document is a supplemental document to our lecture
>   notes and may help in conducting additional research on
>   technologies students are interested in or could be building the
>   computational framework for projects. The write-ups are provided
>   by former students of the i523 and i524 classes.


#### Scientific Writing I [ {{< button ePub >}} ](https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/book/blob/master/vonLaszewski-writing-1.epub?raw=true)

> * Version: Fall2018
> * Editors: Gregor von Laszewski
> * Classes: all 
> * Description: This document describes how to use some easy
>   scientific writing skills to communicate your findings in a report
>   format as required for the class. Topics include plagiarism,
>   emacs, and  markdown.
> * Comment: Please check with your class. Do not underestimate the
>   power of tools other than MSWord. Structured text writing is more
>   than making your content look pretty. Cloud Computing and big data
>   is naturally also about communicating your research. We teach you how.


#### Scientific Writing II - LaTeX [ {{< button PDF >}} ](http://cyberaide.org/papers/vonLaszewski-latex.pdf)


> * Version: Fall2018
> * Editors: Gregor von Laszewski
> * Classes: all 
> * Description: This document describes how to use some easy
>   scientific writing skills and communicate them with the help of
>   LaTeX.
> * Comment: please check with your class if it is allowed to use
>   LaTeX. LaTeX is actually trivial with our documentation. However,
>   we had students in the past that made things unnecessarily
>   complicated and also manipulated our default format. Due to this
>   reason we started in Fall 2018 to experiment with markdown as
>   replacement to LaTeX
