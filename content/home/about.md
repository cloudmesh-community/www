Cloudmesh has a large number of community contributors.  The community
is managed in github.  This includes a large number of projects that
have been conducted at Indiana University . The number is actually
much larger as previous projects are not integrated in our public github.

The list of currently managed projects in github can be found at

* <https://github.com/cloudmesh-community>

We have over 140 repositories.
