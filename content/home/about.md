Cloudmesh has a large number of community contributors.  The community
is managed in github.  They are mostly from classes taught at Indiana
Univerity. The number is actually much larger as previous classes have
not been integrated in github.

The list of currently managed projects in github can be found at

* <https://github.com/cloudmesh-community>

We have over 140 repositories.
